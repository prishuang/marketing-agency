Marketing Agency

This project was created for the marketing agency "Horiseo" with the goal of updating current codes to follow accessibility standards, which will allow site to be optimized for search engines. 

With access to existing codes from the website, the first step was to carefully consider which appropriate semantics to replace <div> with. 

Once replacing <div> with appropriate semantics such as: <section>, <article>, <aside>, <nav>, I worked to clean up and simplify css styles by seeing which codes could be grouped together using class or ids. 

Last but not least, to achieve the goal of accessibility standards, alternate texts were added for each image.
